# EVE Online Recruitment App

## Requirements

- A [Neucore](https://github.com/tkhamez/neucore) installation.

- A MariaDB/MySQL database.

## Deployment

1. Install requirements: `composer install`
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Assign values in `.env`
1. Point webserver to `/public` directory
1. If desired, replace `invTypes.sql` and `invGroups.sql` in `database/dumps` (from https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/)
1. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
1. Run the installer: `php artisan app:install`
1. Ensure php's `max_execution_time` is set to at least 300
1. Add the following to your crontab:  
  ```* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1```
1. To give the 1st account the role `admin`, first log in and then add an entry to the table `account_role` with 
   `account_id`=1, `role_id`=3 and `set`=1.

## Roles and Permissions

Each recruitment ad (either corporation or group) has two roles associated with it: `{name} recruiter`, and `{name}
director` or `{name} manager`. The former allows seeing corp members (for corps), and applications. The latter 
allows managing the ad.

The role `admin` is incredibly powerful, and can assign any role to any character registered on the website.
The role `group admin` allows creation of group ads.
The role `supervisor` allows to generate apps.

Core accounts with a group named `banned` are not allowed to log in.

## Code Modification Options

* To add or remove application states, modify `app/Models/Application.php`. **WARNING**: Do not change existing state
  IDs after deployment, since the keys are used as the ID in the database.
* To add custom application warnings, edit `app/Models/Application.php`. Any strings appended to the `$warnings` array
  in the `addWarnings()` function will be rendered on the application page as warnings.
